      <p>
      Hi! I'm Megan, a Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph. Through my previous co-op experiences, 
      I’ve developed a strong foundation in Cybersecurity and Quality Assurance. I’m passionate about software development 
      and have hands-on experience in full-stack development. Currently, I’m focused on building my portfolio to showcase 
      my projects and skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy trying new foods, hanging out with friends, and playing badminton. 
      I’m always excited to learn, grow, and take on new challenges.
